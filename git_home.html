<h1>Words People Use When They Talk About Git</h1>

<br>
<p>In this tutorial, there are a few words I’m going to use repeatedly, none of which I’d heard before I started learning.
Here’s the big ones:</p>

<br>
<p><b>Command Line:</b> The computer program we use to input Git commands. On a Mac, it’s called Terminal. On a PC, it’s
a non-native program that you download when you download Git for the first time (we’ll do that in the next section). In
both cases, you type text-based commands, known as prompts, into the screen, instead of using a mouse.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Repository:</b>A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to
“repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You
can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Version Control:</b>Basically, the purpose Git was designed to serve. When you have a Microsoft Word file, you either
overwrite every saved file with a new save, or you save multiple versions. With Git, you don’t have to. It keeps
“snapshots” of every point in time in the project’s history, so you can never lose or overwrite it.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Commit:</b>This is the command that gives Git its power. When you commit, you are taking a “snapshot” of your
repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any
previous state.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Branch:</b>How do multiple people work on a project at the same time without Git getting them confused? Usually, they
“branch off” of the main project with their own versions full of changes they themselves have made. After they’re done,
it’s time to “merge” that branch back with the “master,” the main directory of the project.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Snapshot:</b>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks
about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems
(CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes
made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).Git doesn’t think of or store
its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git,
every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like
at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot..</p>

<p><b>Git has three main states that your files can reside in::</b></p>
<br>
<p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Committed State</b> means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
    <li><b>Modified Stat</b> means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</li>
    <li><b>Staged State</b> means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</li>
</ol>
</p>
